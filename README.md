#Geckoboard Widget for Wufoo

We wanted a [Geckoboard](http://geckoboard.com) widget that would desplay entries from Wufoo.  We use a [Wufoo](http://wufoo.com) form to process information and knowing how many requests we've had over time helps us know our utilization.  

##Installation

This is a basic Sinatra app.  It was written to work on Heroku but you could run it anywhere.  If you install it on Heroku you need to add three environment config settings.

    $ heroku config:add FORM=form-name
    $ heroku config:add ACCOUNT=account
    $ heroku config:add API_KEY=S5JI-IDSF-SDFS-DSFD #Not a real key

After you deploy the app you should just be able to added the heroku URL to geckoboard as a custom widget.  Make sure its set to polling and I would up the refresh to a high number so you don't hit Wufoo API Limits (5000/day). 

##Wufoo

I'm using a modified version of the WuParty gem.  This version contains a `count` method that accepts filters. You can read more about filters and Wufoo's API on their [website](http://wufoo.com/docs/api/v3/entries/get/#filter).

Enjoy!
